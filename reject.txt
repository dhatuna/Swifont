애플에서 리뷰 거절이 났는데 다음 사유야.

Guideline 5.2.5 - Legal - Intellectual Property


Your app's metadata includes content that is similar to designs or terms used for Apple products and services and may cause confusion for users. Specifically, your metadata includes:

- Terms for Swift in the app subtitle in an inappropriate manner.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, remove images and terms that are confusingly similar to an Apple product or service from your app's metadata.

Resources

- Learn more about appropriate and inappropriate use of Apple trademarks in the Guidelines for Using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights.
- For information on changing the app name and other metadata in App Store Connect, please review the View and edit app information section of App Store Connect Developer Help.


Guideline 4 - Design


We noticed an issue with your app's user interface that contributes to a lower-quality user experience than App Store users expect.

Specifically, we found that when the user closes the main application window there is no menu item to re-open it.

Next Steps

It would be appropriate for the app to implement a Window menu that lists the main window so it can be reopened, or provide similar functionality in another menu item. 

Alternatively, if the application is a single-window app, it might be appropriate to save data and quit the app when the main window is closed.
